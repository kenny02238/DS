# Data Structures Research Project

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my research on data structures. In this project, I am exploring various data structures, their properties, and their applications in computer science.

## Motivation

Understanding data structures is crucial for efficient and optimized programming. By conducting this research, I aim to deepen my knowledge of different data structures and their use cases.

## Research Scope

My research encompasses the following aspects:

1. **Data Structures:** Exploring various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

2. **Time and Space Complexity:** Analyzing the time and space complexity of different data structure operations.

3. **Implementation:** Providing code examples and implementations of data structures in different programming languages.

Usage
You can explore the different data structure implementations in the codingPractice folder. Each data structure is organized in its own folder and comes with example code and explanations.

Contributions
I welcome contributions and suggestions. If you would like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
