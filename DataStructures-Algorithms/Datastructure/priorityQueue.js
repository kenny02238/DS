// In Computer Science, a priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure,
// but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.
// Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.

// We can implement it with a linked list, queue, array, or other data structure.
// But... Max Heap is the most efficient
