// Minimal Spanning Tree: is a subset of the edges of a connected,
// edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together,
// without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
// For a graph with V vertices, a spanning tree is a subset of V-1 edges
// However, the minimal spanning tree is one whose edge have the smallest total weight among all the spanning trees.
// (This assume a weighted graph; i.e., a graph in which each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.)
